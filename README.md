# Hypothesis-testing-for-comparing-machine-learning-algorithm

## Which machine algorithm would you chose to perform a classification problem?

There are a number of machine learning algorithms which can perform a classification/regression tasks. Typically one can look into the mean performance of difference Machine learning algorithm to chose which one is best for a task. A statistical hypothesis test can be performed to evaluate whether the difference in the mean performance between any two algorithms is real or not.
